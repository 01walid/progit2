= Pro Git, Second Edition

Welcome to the second edition of the Pro Git book.

You can find this book online at: http://git-scm.com/book

Like the first edition, the second edition of Pro Git is open source under a Creative Commons license.

A couple of things have changed since open sourcing the first edition. For one, we've moved from Markdown to the amazing Asciidoc format for the text of the book. We've also moved to using O'Reilly's https://atlas.oreilly.com[Atlas platform] for generating continuous builds of the book so all major formats are always available in every language.

We've also moved to keeping the translations in separate repositories rather than subdirectories of the English repository. See the Translations section for more information.

== How To Generate the Book

There are two ways to generate e-book content from this source code.

The easiest way is simply to let us do it. A robot is standing by to look for new work on the main branch and automatically build it for everyone.

You can find the current builds on http://git-scm.com/book[] and more information about the builds available at https://progit.org[].

The other way to generate e-book files is to do so manually with Asciidoctor. If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake book:build
Converting to HTML...
 -- HTML output at progit.html
Converting to EPub...
 -- Epub output at progit.epub
Converting to Mobi (kf8)...
 -- Mobi output at progit.mobi
Converting to PDF...
 -- PDF  output at progit.pdf
----

This uses the `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf` and `asciidoctor-epub` projects.

== Translations

Translations to other languages are highly encouraged but handled a little differently than the first edition. We now keep each translation in a separate repository and automatically build the output files through Atlas. This was something that was really difficult in the last edition.

Since each translation is a different repository, we can also have different maintainers for each project. The Pro Git team simply pulls them in and builds them for the translation teams. To get automatic builds, translations repositories will have to be under the https://github.com/progit[progit organization on GitHub].

You can find out information on all the current translations and information on how to start your own at: http://progit.org/translations[].

== Figures

The images in this book were generated using http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/[Sketch 3], with the link:diagram-source/progit.sketch[included sketchbook file].

To add a figure:

. Add a page to the sketchbook. Try to use the included symbols wherever possible.
. Add a ``slice'' to your page. Give it a name that matches the destination PNG filename, relative from the root of the source directory.
. Make sure your slice is set to export at 3x size.
